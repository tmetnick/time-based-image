Overview of System Functionality
For this project, I created a simple webpage that changes the image it displays depending on the time of day. Using HTML and JavaScript, I added time-aware functionality so the site shows a different image in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

Known issues or assumptions
The text may be hard to read in certain sports of the background because the backgrounds are not solid and have dark and light areas.
